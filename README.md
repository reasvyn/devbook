# DevBook

**Markdown-based learning resources for developers.**

DevBook is a living library of technical knowledge for developers, by developers. Every concept is explained in plain Markdown — from the mathematical foundations that power machine learning, to the networking protocols that move data across the internet, to the programming patterns that shape production-grade software.

Whether you're brushing up on fundamentals or diving into a new area, DevBook gives you the signal without the noise: concise, practical, and ready to open in your editor.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/devbook.git
cd devbook
# That's it — open any .md file in your editor or browser
```

No dependencies. No build step. No `npm install`.

## Structure

### Directory Convention

```
{module}/
├── index.md
└── {submodule}/
    ├── index.md
    └── {level:intro|beginner|intermediate|advanced}/
        └── {short-description}.md
```

- **`index.md`** — every module and submodule **must** have an `index.md` that lists and links to its children.
- **Level** — each content file sits in a difficulty level directory:
  - `intro` — pure concepts, principles, and philosophy of the field itself. Not for specific sub-topics (those go to `beginner`).
  - `beginner` — specific topics within the field, explained from the ground up.
  - `intermediate` — deeper dives, practical application, common patterns.
  - `advanced` — specialized or research-level content.
- **Short description** — a hyphenated slug describing the topic (e.g., `why-math.md`, `linear-algebra.md`).

Every document follows a mandatory format:

1. **Title** — document title
2. **Description** — brief overview and why it matters
3. **Prerequisites** — what you should know before reading
4. **Table of Contents** — section navigation
5. **Content / Material** — the core material
6. **Study Cases** (Optional) — real-world walkthroughs
7. **Examples** (Optional) — additional practical examples
8. **Glossary** — key terms and definitions
9. **Next Steps** — where to go from here

## Why Markdown?

| Reason | Why it matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Zero friction** | Open any `.md` file — no tooling, no setup, no login. |
| **Git-friendly** | Meaningful diffs, easy reviews, simple collaboration. |
| **Universal renderer** | GitHub, VS Code, Obsidian, Notion — every platform speaks Markdown. |
| **Focus on substance** | No styling rabbit holes; the content is the product. |
| **Extensible** | Embed LaTeX via `$$`, diagrams via Mermaid, or ASCII art. |

## How to Use This

- **Browse by topic** — start with any directory that interests you.
- **Follow a path** — each directory's README suggests a learning order.
- **Search** — `grep -r "topic" devbook/` to find what you need fast.
- **Contribute** — found an error? Have a better explanation? Open a PR.
